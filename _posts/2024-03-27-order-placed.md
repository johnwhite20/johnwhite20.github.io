I placed an order with [Glenquicken Roadrecycling](https://glenquickenroadrecycling.co.uk/) to repair the track. 

After giving all of us time to examine the repair plan and some discussions I placed an order, today I received emailed confirmation of our order to repair the track.

The track continues to deteriorate and I feel it is only a matter of time before delivery drivers and others start to refuse to use it. I hope very much the work can take place soon and I will communicate any updates to you as soon as I receive them.
