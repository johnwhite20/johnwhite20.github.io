Mike McCart from [Glenquicken Roadrecycling](https://glenquickenroadrecycling.co.uk/) carried out a site survey today. 

He explained that the road base needs to be built up in order for water to run off the finshed top surface. Mike identified the field stone we have here as unsuitable for being crushed by the machines they use as part of the work. 

He also told me that there would have to be additional stone delivered to build up the base of the road and more stone added to insure a sound final surface and we would have to ensure water is allowed to flow away from the road and into the fields on either side to prevent future damage. He also explained that the finished road could be kept in good order by adding gravel to any emerging puddles and then the new stone being compacted.

Mike is going to prepare a quote to carry out the work on the road including supplying the additional material needed to form the new surface.
