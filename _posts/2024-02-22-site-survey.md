Mike McCart from [Glenquicken Roadrecycling](https://glenquickenroadrecycling.co.uk/) carried out a site survey today and recommended additional work and materials are required. 

He explained that the road base needs to be built up in order for water to run off the finished top surface. There is simply not enough material in the road to give that necessary height. Mike identified the field stone we have here as unsuitable for being crushed by the machines they use as part of the work. 
He also told me that there would have to be larger crushed stone delivered to build up the base of the road and finer stone added to insure a sound final surface. I asked if flattening the road by scraping it with a digger could reduce the amount of stone required but he said the track is too low and to produce a good long lasting roadway it was necessary to add more material.
We would have to ensure water is allowed to flow away from the road and into the fields on either side to prevent future damage to any new roadway. He also explained that the finished road could be kept in good order by adding gravel to any emerging puddles and then the new stone being compacted.
Glenquicken have done this type of work for several large companies and charitable organisations, he seemed to know what he was talking about.
Mike is going to prepare a quote to carry out the all work on the road including supplying the additional material needed to form the new surface. I will add this information as soon as it arrives and let you all know.
