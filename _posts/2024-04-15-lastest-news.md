I have received an email reply regarding scheduling the work. 

Following an email enquiring about scheduling for our driveway repair and informing them of the slight changes to the areas to be work on I have received a reply from Glenquicken.

So sadly the latest news is that there is no news and Glenquicken are waiting for an improvement of the weather to ensure our job is carried out properly. I will, of course, keep you up to date with any news I receive.
