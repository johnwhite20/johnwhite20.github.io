The road repairs are planned for 28th May 2024. 

Mike McCart has just informed me by email that the work to repair our road has been scheduled for Tuesday 28th May with the machinery arriving Monday 27th May.

If anyone needs to travel on Tuesday 28th May they will need to leave a car on the other side of the works. The road to the large tower is a good size but is too narrow. Perhaps West Balscalloch Farm would allow us to park outside the newly refurbished Ivy Cottage for the day?

I will ensure everyone is aware of this schedule.
