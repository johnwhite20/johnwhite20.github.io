The track is nearly finished and is looking good. 

The workmen are nearly finished with their work on our track. The first two days were spent digging drainage slots in the verge, laying down large, coarse stone to raise the level of the road and allow a space for water to drain away beneath the surface we drive on. This stone was rolled flat and compacted after they spread it.

We were delayed by the quarry closure on Thursday but they spread much finer stone today, set the camber of the track and rolled it flat on the previous work. I've driven a section of it today and it is very smooth, certainly when compared with our old track.

I've ordered a small petrol plate compactor, or whacker plate as it is sometimes known, which I shall use when adding gravel to any damage the road receives. This should help keep our investment in good condition for much longer. We should encourage any visitors to keep their speed down when driving the track as 'spirited' driving could tear the surface up. I thought of getting a sign showing which households live down our track and also asking them to drive under 20 mph while advising them that there is CCTV in use. I think prevention is better than cure!

Graham advised me that we should try and avoid driving on existing tyre tracks for the next few days if possible as the stone will naturally compact a little more as it begins to be driven on.
