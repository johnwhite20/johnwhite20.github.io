I received the quotation today to carry out the repairs to our track including the additional materials required. 

Following my initial note to you all everybody spoke to me and agreed to go ahead with the survey and see what it suggested. The survey took place 22nd February and I received an email today from Mike McCart at [Glenquicken Roadrecycling](https://glenquickenroadrecycling.co.uk/). The text is shown below:

As you will see from the quotation that was attached and my updated spreadsheet (both available from the link in the top right) this increases the original costs significantly. Infact the costs more than double but the work should give us a better repaired track with far greater lifespan than any quick and cheap repair we could do. 

I feel that the track is simply too far gone for any quick repair so my vote is that we go ahead with the project and that I place an order with Glenquicken to carry out the work as soon as possible. This project requires us all to agree before going ahead so I am keen to hear your views on this matter and whether you also wish to proceed. Please feel free to email me using John@nabbers.org or phone me on 07795 102704.
